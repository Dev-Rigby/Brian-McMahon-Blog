Responsive web design is about creating dynamic web pages that look good on all devices. A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes, printers, and viewports. It adapts the webpages resolution to your phone, tablet, phone, etc. Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS. It is not a program or a JavaScript. All popular CSS Frameworks offer responsive design, and they are easy to use.

Two examples of CSS Frameworks are W3.CSS and Bootstrap. The latter uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery to make responsive web pages. W3.CSS is designed to be a high-quality alternative to Bootstrap that is mobile first. It is smaller and faster andis designed to be independent of jQuery and other js libraries.

Responsive Web design practice consists of flexible grids and layouts, images and use of CSS. Page elements are rearranged as the viewport grows or shrinks, and it relies on proportion-based grids to rearrange content and design elements.  It uses breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is used above a breakpoint and another design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are commonly based on the width of the browser.

Responsive web design is a great way to adapt a full site to mobile devices without having to create a brand-new mobile site or mobile application. Because there is only one code base, the maintenance is easier and significantly less as the code does not have to change as new devices become available in the marketplace. When operational changes are needed, the change only has to be made once. Also, it is easier to gather analytical data as opposed to monitoring multiple websites. The website is more consistent because all data is centralized. The changes and rearrangements of the pages happen on the browser side. The page’s design and development respond to the user’s behavior based on the screen size, platform, and orientation. The adaptability and flexibility of these websites helps attract a wider audience and provide a good experience.

One drawback may be that there is more work at the beginning as developers have to work closely to coordinate the coding of the website’s presentation. There may be an issue with performance because the same code is delivered to all devices and the device is responsible to figure out what it needs.
